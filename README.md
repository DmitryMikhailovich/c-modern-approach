# Solution code for C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd edition)
My solutions to programming assignments and exercises in C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd edition.  
Each chapter directory is divided into (possibly) three subdirectories:  
- `programs` - code listings for examples in the chapter  
- `exercises` - solution code for *Exercises* section of the chapter  
- `projects` - solution code for *Programming projects* section of the chapter
